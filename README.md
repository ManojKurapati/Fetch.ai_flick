AI-powered habit-breaking app using AgentVerse and Transact AI. Users stake funds via escrow; if they stay consistent, funds are sent to Aave/Compound to earn yield. After 20 days, principal + yield is returned. Lapses redirect funds to successful users.

🧠 HabitDestroyer

HabitDestroyer is an AI-powered app built using **AgentVerse** and **Transact AI**, helping users quit harmful habits like smoking or vaping. Users stake funds via an escrow agent; consistency is rewarded with DeFi yield, while lapses forfeit rewards to successful users.

3. Track : Users self-report habit lapses via daily prompts.
4. Reward :
   - Success: Principal + yield returned to user.
   - Lapse: Funds redirected to a reward pool for successful users.
